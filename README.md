About Me!
My name is Sadiya.
Today's date is October 11th, 2024.
I'm in 10th grade and my CTE course is Web and App Development.
In my own words, a repository is a project you're working on.
I plan on sleeping for the three day weekend because this week of school has been so exhausting with the amount of schoolwork and tests I had in a few days.
